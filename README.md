# Accentuator (abandoned)
## NOTICE: USE POWERTOYS, THEY HAVE WHAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE.
---
### Small app that opens a toolbar when you press Alt+Shift+A where you can type an accent without having accents on the keyboard.
### Not fully working yet, only one accent is implemented and it only works on Win32 apps, not UWP.
### For now, AutoHotkey is required for this to work. Compiled executable coming soon, when it's actually working.
